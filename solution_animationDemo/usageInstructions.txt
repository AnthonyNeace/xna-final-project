ANIMATION DEMO USAGE
--------------------

1. You *must* be using "XNA 4.0 Refresh" version for multiple animations in .FBX files
   to work correctly.  This is an updated version of XNA 4.0 that patches .FBX issues
   that were present in the initial download on microsoft's page.

   Update URL: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27599

2. The SkinnedModelPipeline DLLs present in this package are compiled for 64-bit use only.

3. To load models:

	a) Load model into program as you normally would
	b) In properties window (below the solution explorer window in the UI) 
           change Content Processor to 'SkinnedModelProcessor'

4. I've installed sample logic to switch between textures and animations as a framework
   for what can be used in the actual game.

   SPACE switches quickly between textures.
   F1-F8 switches between animations.

   Some animation initialization locations are slightly offset the hippo's starting
   location.  We can transform/rotate the hippo in-world with the logic we use to
   determine when we are going to use these animations.
